# Football Data API

**Football Data API** is an educational backend project built with **NestJS** and **TypeScript**.  
It provides a simple REST API for managing football clubs, their players, and user favorites.  
Data can come from local storage (in-memory or JSON) or be enriched from the public API [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/).



## Features

- **List all clubs** with their main details  
- **Display club details** and player squads  
- **Add new clubs** locally via `POST /clubs`  
- **Delete clubs** by ID  
- **Manage favorites** (`/clubs/favori`)  
- **Search** clubs or players by name or acronym  
- **Integrate external data** from *football-data.org* (read-only, via API key)



## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Build a RESTful API using **NestJS (Node.js + TypeScript)**
- Organize code into **Controllers, Services, and Modules**
- Manage **in-memory data** and optional persistence via JSON
- Consume an **external public API** using `HttpModule` and Axios
- Handle multiple routes and HTTP methods cleanly

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/clubs` | Returns all clubs (sorted by name) |
| `GET` | `/clubs/details/:id` | Returns details for one club |
| `POST` | `/clubs` | Adds a new club to local storage |
| `DELETE` | `/clubs/:id` | Deletes a club by ID |
| `GET` | `/clubs/favori` | Returns the favorite clubs list |
| `POST` | `/clubs/favori` | Adds a club to favorites |
| `POST` | `/clubs/search` | Searches by club name, TLA, or player |



## External API (football-data.org)

This project can connect to [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/).  
You’ll need a free API key to fetch external data.

## Educational Goals

This project was created for educational and demonstration purposes, focusing on backend fundamentals with NestJS and TypeScript.

- Understanding the NestJS architecture — interaction between Controllers, Services, and Modules.  
- Learning to handle HTTP requests and responses within a RESTful API.  
- Practicing TypeScript classes and interfaces for structured and type-safe data modeling.  
- Exploring how to integrate and consume external REST APIs securely using API keys.  
- Implementing basic data persistence and in-memory storage to simulate database operations.
